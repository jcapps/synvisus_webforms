            <b>1.   Types of Information Collected.</b> We may collect certain personally 
            identifiable and non-personally identifiable information in connection with your 
            access and/or use of the Site.  We may collect personally identifiable and/or 
            non-personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of ways. For example, 
            we may collect certain personally identifiable (as well as non-personally 
            identifiable) information that you voluntarily provide to us on, by means of, 
            through, or via the Site when you purchase products or services on or through the 
            Site, create an account on the Site, register or provide your email address on or via 
            the Site, and/or contact us via the Site for customer service or any other purposes. 
            When contacting Company via the Site, you may be asked to provide your name, email 
            address, and/or certain other information. The types of personally identifiable and 
            other information that may be collected from Users in connection with their access or

            telephone number, and other contact data or information, country of origin, 
            demographic data (such as User’s zip code or age), and, as applicable, billing 
            information and other financial information collected to process payments to, or 
            orders and purchases made from, Company via the Site  (such as credit card, debit 
            card or other payment information), and other information requested during any account 
            registration process.  If you correspond or communicate with us via email through the 
            Site, we may collect and retain the content of your email messages, your email address, 
            and any other information you provide, and our responses.  Other information 
            voluntarily provided through or via the Site may include without limitation 
            testimonials, feedback, comments, messages, suggestions, proposals, ideas, product 
            descriptions and/or reviews, and information provided when you participate on, through

            certain other information, whether from your browser or otherwise, when you visit the 
            Site, such as, by way of example and not limitation, your IP address, domains, cookies, 
            browser details, timestamps, referring pages, data about which pages you visit on the 
            Site, and other information about how you use the Site.  While not all of the 
            information that Company collects from Users is personally identifiable, it may be 
            associated with personally identifiable information that Users provide or have provided 
            Company through or via the Site or otherwise.  Additionally, certain information 
            regarding your computer systems, network locations, IP address and software may be 
            communicated to Company in certain circumstances by the digital rights management systems 
            associated with certain content or material that you download or access via the Site 
            in order to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of the associated content.  
            Non-personally identifiable information collected by Company (such as by way of example 
            and not limitation patterns of utilization) is exclusively owned by Company and may be

        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Cookies</u><br /> 
            Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive 
            that can be retrieved later to identify you.  The use of cookies is common on the internet.  
            We may choose to use cookies and/or web logs files in order, among other purposes, to 
            monitor website traffic and usage and/or to recognize return visitors as a way to facilitate 
            and/or customize your use of the Site.  Most internet browsers are set to automatically 
            accept cookies.  By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all 
            cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.  If you reject all 
            cookies or allow your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set, we cannot guarantee 
            that all parts of the Site will function properly.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>IP Addresses</u><br />
            We may receive the uniform resource locator (URL) of the web site from which you came and 
            the web site to which you proceed once you leave the Site.  We may also receive the IP 
            address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your 
            computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of 
            your Internet service provider (ISP).  The linkage between your IP address and your 
            personally identifiable information may be shared with third parties in accordance with 
            this Privacy Policy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Web Beacons and Ad Networks</u><br />
            We may allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users via 
            the Site.  Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors 
            and research firms.  Company may “target” some ads to Users that fit a certain general 
            profile.  To deliver these ads properly, the Site may include a file, called a web beacon, 
            from these ad networks within pages served by the Site or implement other monitoring 
            technologies so the networks may provide anonymous, aggregated auditing, research and 
            reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other web sites.  
            These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other web 
            sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads.  In addition, the Site may use the 
            technology of ad networks to serve ads only when you visit this Site.  Ad networks may use 
            non-personal information, such as your state or zip code, in order to provide advertisements 
            about goods and services that may be of particular interest to you while you visit this Site.  
            Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad 
            network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you 
            had requested a web page from their site.

            contractors, attorneys, accountants, and business partners in connection with the purposes set 
            forth or described in this Privacy Policy or in connection with the operation of its business or

            safety of Company, any User or any third party or to prevent the perpetration of any illegal or 
            harmful activity. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that 
            we in good faith believe to be unlawful.   Company may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data 
            based on information collected from Users to content developers, investors, advertisers and actual

            and other information collected from Users in connection with or in contemplation of a sale of its 
            assets (or of any of its assets) or business or a merger, acquisition, consolidation or

            submitted to, maintained on or transmitted from its systems will be completely secure.  Company is
