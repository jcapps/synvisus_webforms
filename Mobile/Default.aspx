    <h4><b>Value Proposition</b></h4>
    <p><u>Business Insights</u></p>
    <p>
        With extensive experience in a variety of industries, our consultants 
        bring a practical sensibility and industry-specific expertise to the 
        strategic challenges facing our clients. We understand that slick 
        software builds mean nothing unless applied in the context of a functional 
        organizational structure and a sound strategic vision.
    </p>
    <p><u>Technical Capabilities</u></p>
    <p>
        Business savvy does not have to come at the expense of technical proficiency. 
        Our developers bring state-of-the-art forecasting methodology and optimization 
        techniques to bear on the analytical challenges we help our clients overcome. 
        We understand that strategic vision is only as good as the analysis that drives it.

    <h3><span class="dummy-top-mobile" id="What"></span><b>WHAT WE DO</b></h3>
    <h4><b>Forecasting Support</b></h4>
    <p>
        Accurate forecasting plays an essential role at multiple levels of an 
        organization. Fine-grained estimates of demand volume help to minimize 
        manufacturing and operational costs over the short term, while high-level 
        projections of sales revenue inform strategic planning and organizational 
        development over the long term.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our consultants offer expertise in both the technical and organizational 
        aspects of forecasting. We will work with you to apply rigorous statistical 
        techniques to your data sources, develop a forecast that fits the unique 
        contours of your market and business needs, and identity and quantify 
        sources of risk and uncertainty.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Software Development</b></h4>
    <p>
        Whether the target is a simple task or a complex analysis, automation can, 
        if employed judiciously, save time and reduce errors. But too often 
        custom-developed business-to-business software is expensive and user-unfriendly. 
        Clients end up wasting more resources on licensing fees and training than they 
        save by using the software.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have found that there is tremendous untapped potential in the office 
        productivity software clients already use on a daily basis. Our developers 
        will help you tap this potential to build tools that have the collaborative 
        and analytical capabilities of a bottom-up custom solution&mdash;all at a fraction 
        of the price, on a faster development schedule, and without the need to adapt 
        to a new software environment.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Operations Management</b></h4>
    <p>
        Profit margins for manufacturers are increasingly driven by supply 
        chain management. Furthermore, as online channels begin to displace traditional 
        brick-and-mortar outlets, retailers must find ways to adapt and maintain efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our consultants will help you construct a multi-channel and/or multi-SKU demand 
        planning module that reflects the complexities of your operations and enables 
        you to optimize resource allocation. We will work with you to ensure that the 
        module is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with the other modules in your 
        operations management system.
