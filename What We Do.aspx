            <h3>Forecasting Support</h3>
            <p style="font-size:16px">
                Accurate forecasting plays an essential role at multiple levels of an 
                organization. Fine-grained estimates of demand volume help to minimize 
                manufacturing and operational costs over the short term, while high-level 
                projections of sales revenue inform strategic planning and organizational 
                development over the long term.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px">
                Our consultants offer expertise in both the technical and organizational 
                aspects of forecasting. We will work with you to apply rigorous statistical 
                techniques to your data sources, develop a forecast that fits the unique 
                contours of your market and business needs, and identity and quantify 
                sources of risk and uncertainty.

                Whether the target is a simple task or a complex analysis, automation can, 
                if employed judiciously, save time and reduce errors. But too often 
                custom-developed business-to-business software is expensive and user-unfriendly. 
                Clients end up wasting more resources on licensing fees and training than they 
                save by using the software.

                We have found that there is tremendous untapped potential in the office 
                productivity software clients already use on a daily basis. Our developers 
                will help you tap this potential to build tools that have the collaborative 
                and analytical capabilities of a bottom-up custom solution&mdash;all at a fraction 
                of the price, on a faster development schedule, and without the need to adapt 
                to a new software environment.

            <h3>Operations Management</h3>
            <p style="font-size:16px">
                Profit margins for manufacturers are increasingly driven by supply 
                chain management. Furthermore, as online channels begin to displace traditional 
                brick-and-mortar outlets, retailers must find ways to adapt and maintain efficiency.

            <p style="font-size:16px">
                Our consultants will help you construct a multi-channel and/or multi-SKU demand 
                planning module that reflects the complexities of your operations and enables 
                you to optimize resource allocation. We will work with you to ensure that the 
                module is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with the other modules in your 
                operations management system.
